    <h1 class="song-title">Black crow</h1>
    <h4>Artist:<span> Joni Mitchell</span></h4>
    <p>There's a crow flying, dark and ragged, tree to tree
        <br>He's black as the highway that's leading me
        <br>Now he's diving down to pick up on something shiny
        <br>I feel like that black crow flying in a blue sky
    </p>
    <p>I took a ferry to the highway then I drove to a pontoon plane
        <br>I took a plane to a taxi and a taxi to a train, I've been traveling so long
        <br>How am I ever gonna know my home when I see it again
        <br>I'm like a black crow flying in a blue, blue sky
    </p>
    <P>In search of love and music my whole life has been
        <br>Illumination, corruption, diving, diving, diving
        <br>Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
        <br>Just like that black crow flying in a blue sky
    </P>
    <p>I looked at the morning after being up all night
        <br>I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
        <br>I looked out the window and saw that ragged soul take flight
        <br>I saw a black crow flying in a blue sky
    </p>
    <p>Oh, I'm like a black crow flying in a blue sky</p>
